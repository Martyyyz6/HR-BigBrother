FUNCTIONALITY: Retrieves user information.

This is a script I constructed and ran on a game web application to scrape lists of data. 
I integrated it with the Discord API so a Discord bot could post selected items from those lists into a server on command. 
The goal was to let users quickly access specific in-game information without manually running the script or reading command-line output.

With this setup, you can monitor in-game users directly from an external environment (the Discord app) without being on the game/website. The script was hosted on Replit to keep the bot running 24/7, and it can also be modified to run locally.

EXPLANATION — This project was part of my online reconnaissance and surface-level penetration testing. 
It focused on collecting information and performing checks without exploiting vulnerabilities or accessing restricted data.

CAUTION — The script has not been updated since March 17, 2022; some necessary components are outdated (e.g., headers), but the overall architecture should remain valid.
DISCLAIMER — For educational purposes only. ***I do not condone malicious use.***
