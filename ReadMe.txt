FUNCTIONALITY: obtains a user's online presence and avatar.

A script that I used to run on a virtual reality game(https://www.everskies.com), 
which would scrape lists of data. 
This script was further integrated with Discord's API so that a Discord bot would send 
the chosen elements from the list into a discord server on command.
The reason for this integration was so that the user could obtain certain in-game info fast 
and easy without having to manually run the script or read results off a command line.
With this script you could simply monitor in-game users from within the Discord app without actually 
having to be in the game/website. 
Furthermore, this script was hosted online on https://replit.com to keep the bot active 24/7.
The script can be modified to run locally.
